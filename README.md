# Virtual-contolled-mouse
This is my first project on Image processing in which I made a virtual mouse controller using pynput and wxpython libraries.
There are two green papers fixed on my fingers and they are identified using colour segmentation.
The mid-point of the line joining the two segments is given the mouse control.
When the two segments comes closer, the mouse clicks.
